          <ol>
              <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
              <p>
                <li>
                    Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves, and a large
                    slice of onion in a stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a boil,
                    and gently simmer for about 20 minutes to blend flavors.
                </li>
              </p>
              <p>
                <li>
                  Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl,
                  or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.
                </li>
              </p>
              <p>
                <li>
                  Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot.
                  Stir in flour to make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly,
                  until mixture turns medium brown.
                </li>
              </p>
              <p>
                <li>
                    Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent
                    lumps from forming, then stir in the rest.
                </li>
              </p>
              <p>
                <li>
                    Season with sugar and salt to taste.
                </li>
              </p>
              <p>
                <li>
                    Serve hot and enjoy!
                </li>
