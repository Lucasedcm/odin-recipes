                  ingredients for chicken salad into a satisfying mixture of flavors and textures.
                  Use your choice of regular or reduced fat mayonnaise. In this chicken salad recipe,
                  the mayonnaise is enhanced with a tablespoon of lemon juice for brightness and a
                  Â¼ teaspoon of ground black pepper. Taste the dressing before mixing it with the chicken;
